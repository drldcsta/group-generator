# Team Generator

This is a simple team generator written in pure HTML/CSS/JS. The text input area will dynamically resize as names are put in. Names are auto-split by commas, so a user can paste in a comma separated list without worrying about formatting. 

TODO: 

* find a way to keep text area from overflowing if list is extra long

* add AndAt branding to the teams view
    * need to learn how to mask SVGs first
    * thinking opaque background 

* Look into issue with grid-template-areas looking different in FF and Chrome

* Add a "copy teams" button that will copy teams to clipboard
    * Allow user to decide format (wrapped for markdown, arrays, json, etc)

* Convince someone else to do the styling

* Add Mozart's Ghost Easter Egg
